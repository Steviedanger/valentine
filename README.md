Well this is just a sample i was trying to make. The idea is based on some events that go on during valentine's day. But i payed more attention to the cheating couples who end up breaking their partner's hearts, or other people's hearts.
In the initial background, you can see a pic of a girl/woman crying, after getting a heart break, or let's say after finding out her partner was cheating.
First background contains a button (fall in love) and a text ( People would get their hearts broken).
When we click on the button, a second background pops up which consists of a laughing emoji.
Well, you just saw somebody crying due to a heart break and you clicked on the button to find love.
So the second button is all about other people laughing at someone who just got their heart broken, a common situation you would find in certain parts of the world.
Thank you for visiting my page. Merci. Gracias!!
